Johnson County Multi-Jurisdictional
Hazard Mitigation Plan
2014 - 2019
Purpose of Hazard Mitigation Planning
• To identify how a community can minimize death, injury,
property damage, and community disruption caused by natural,
human caused, or combination hazards
• To use a proactive rather than reactive approach to reduce the
negative impacts of potential hazards
• Maintain eligibility to apply for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program
funding, which is available after a federal disaster declaration is
issued in Iowa
Steps in the Plan Development
Process
1. Create local planning team
2. Identify and rank hazards
3. Identify critical facilities and vulnerable
populations
4. Determine hazard mitigation goals
5. Discuss current mitigation efforts
6. Identify potential mitigation projects
7. Evaluate and prioritize projects
8. Discuss action plan for implementing projects
9. Determine future monitoring of the plan
Type of Hazard Mitigation Plans
Single Jurisdiction
• Includes one local government
entity
• Analysis of hazards focuses on
local conditions
• Mitigation strategy focuses on
local priorities and capabilities
Multi-jurisdictional
• Includes all local government
entities in the county
– Unincorporated areas
– Cities
– School districts
– University of Iowa
• Analysis of hazards focuses on
countywide conditions unless
local conditions are unique
• Mitigation strategy focuses on
local priorities and capabilities

Identify hazards - types of hazards
Natural vs. Human
Caused/Combination
• Natural hazards occur due to
climate, geology, or hydrology
• Human caused hazards occur due
to human actions
• Combination hazards occur due
to climate, geology, or hydrology
in conjunction with human
actions
Countywide vs. Local
• Countywide hazards have an
equal chance of affecting each
community in the county
• Or, a countywide hazard is a
widespread event that affects the
entire county
• Local hazards are not applicable
to the entire county because
environmental factors such as
geology, hydrology, or local
infrastructure vary
Identify hazards – natural vs. human caused/combination
Natural
• Flash Flood
• Tornadoes
• Windstorms
• Extreme Heat
• Hailstorms
• Grass or Wild Land Fire
• Sink Holes
• River Flooding
• Severe Winter Storms
• Drought
• Earthquakes
• Landslide
• Expansive Soils
• Thunderstorm and Lightning
• Dam Failure
• Levee Failure
Human Caused/Combination
• Human Disease
• Hazardous Materials
• Transportation Incident
• Infrastructure Failure
• Terrorism
• Radiological
• Animal/Plant/Crop Disease

Prioritize hazards – hazard risk
assessment
• Assessment factors
– Probability
– Magnitude/Severity
– Warning Time
– Duration
• Factors valued 1 through 4
• Factors assigned based on historical occurrences, existing
hazard mitigation plans, 2010 Iowa Hazard Mitigation Plan,
and local knowledge.
• Sum of factors = assessment score
Prioritize hazards - hazard priority level
• Priority 1
– Risk assessment score is high relative to other hazards
– Occurred recently with severe impacts requiring long-term recovery
– Planning Team will identify potential mitigation projects
• Priority 2
– Risk assessment score is mid-range relative to other hazards
– Planning Team will identify unique or combination mitigation projects
• Priority 3
– Risk assessment score is low relative to other hazards
– Acceptable level of risk with current conditions
– Unique mitigation projects may not be cost effective or projects may
already be complete and/or in progress
– Planning Team will discuss potential mitigation actions

Identify critical facilities
• Critical facilities comprise all public and private facilities deemed
essential for the delivery of vital services, protection of special
populations, and the provision of other services of importance
• Examples
– City Hall
– Fire Department
– Police Department
– Emergency Operations Center
– Hospital
• Existing vs. future critical facilities
• Countywide vs. local critical facilities
Identify vulnerable populations
• Individuals who may be especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of hazards
• Examples
– Young and/or elderly
– Physically impaired individuals
– Cognitively impaired individuals
– Hospitalized patients and others with medical
conditions
– Non-English speaking individuals
– Mobile/manufactured home residents
– Outdoor workers and events
Determine hazard mitigation goals
1. Protect the health and safety of residents and/or students, visitors, and
emergency personnel (paid or volunteer) during and after hazard events.
2. Minimize losses to existing and future structures in hazard areas. Critical
facilities are priority structures.
3. Maintain local services and infrastructure in order to reduce community,
economic, and environmental disruption during and after hazard events.
4. Educate residents and visitors about local hazards and the resources
available in their community.
5. Apply public funds to hazard mitigation projects in an efficient and fair
manner.
Determine Mitigation Strategy
• For each hazard
– Discuss current mitigation efforts
– Discuss potential mitigation projects, evaluate,
prioritize, and discuss action plan
• Are secondary hazards addressed?
• What goals are addressed by the project?
• What is the potential project benefit?
• What is the potential project cost?
• What is the lead agency and potential partner(s)?
• What are potential sources of funding?
• What is the potential project timeline?
• What is the project priority level?
Project benefit level vs. cost level
Benefit Cost
Low
o Results are difficult to determine and/or may not
result in long-term reduction of risk from hazard(s)
addressed
o Definite community opposition
o Lead agency may encounter capability or legal issues
o Existing funding is adequate or the project can be
completed through volunteer and/or staff time
o Anticipated to cost less than $10,000
Medium
o Results are likely a long-term reduction of risk from
hazard(s) addressed and/or results are not
widespread
o Potential community opposition
o Lead agency has capabilities and legal jurisdiction
o Requires amending the budget and/or requires a
bond to complete the project
o Anticipated to cost between $10,000 and $100,000
High
o Results are likely immediate and/or widespread
reduction of risk from hazard(s) addressed
o Generally supported by the community
o Lead agency has capabilities and legal jurisdiction
o Existing funding is not adequate to complete the
project
o Funding may only be available through
grants/assistance
o Anticipated to cost greater than $100,000
Project priority level
• Priority level 1 – Immediate or primary focus in the
next five years, project will likely have a high benefit
level
• Priority level 2 – Will become a primary focus in 5 to
10 years and/or project is cost prohibitive, project will
likely have a high or medium benefit level
• Priority level 3 – Will be a primary focus in 10 years or
beyond, project is cost prohibitive and/or will likely
have a low benefit level
Unincorporated Johnson County Action Plan
All proposed mitigation actions for Unincorporated Johnson County are considered high priority.
Mitigation actions in the action plan will be considered for completion in the next five years.
Availability of funding will be the main determinant of whether or not a mitigation action will be completed.

Discuss future monitoring of the plan
• Information to consider
– Plan must be updated every 5 years (April 2019)
– Updates typically begin 2 years before plan expiration per
planning grant guidelines
• Monitoring ideas to consider
– Internal review of the plan – annually, biannually, etc.
– Review when Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds are
available from the state
– Review before budget/Capital Improvements Program
preparation
– Others?
Moving forward
• Review of hazard risk assessment, mitigation
strategy, and future monitoring of plan – ongoing
for next 5 years
• 30-day public comment period – December 2013
• Submitted plan for review – January 2014
• Back from FEMA with comments
• Adoption Process underway County Wide
• Need Adoption by Board within 2 weeks
• Grant close-out – by end of April 2014
